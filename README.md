trophic-aggregations
====================

This repository creates codes for obtaining the Results of the segments Lindeman Trophic Aggregations (Containing the Trophic Spine) and the Biogeochemical Cycle Analysis (to be added later) of the NETWRK package.

The function trophicaggregations.R does the Trophic Aggregations according to the Ulanowicz school of Network Analysis. The function lists the following outputs as the software NETWRK 4.2b:

1. Lindeman Transformation Matrix
2. Effective Trophic Levels
3. Canonical Exports
4. Canonical Respiration
5. Grazing Chain
6. Returns to detrital pool
7. Detrivory
8. Inputs to Detrital pool
9. Circulation within detrital pool
10. Lindeman Spine
11. Trophic efficiencies
